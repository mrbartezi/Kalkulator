Bugs to fix:
- When first number is negative, display will show "-" instead of first digit of second number,
- Exception when you first click any operation button before typing any number,
- Executing latest operation when you clicked multiple operation buttons before typing a new number, instead of executing every operation before,

Things to add:
- Function to "." button,
- Function to EXT button,
